She cannot increase the current without some device capable of generating it, since she cannot create electricity from nothing. For example, the mage can direct the electricity in a building to single or multiple outlets, cut the power, or divide power going to one outlet to many other sources. This requires a method of conduction, like existing wiring or metal. She can also cause existing electrical currents to arc (such as striking a target near a wall outlet), or redirect it away from a particular device. Causing a short or using the electrical current to attack a target usually burns out the breakers or shorts out a device afterward, unless it’s made to withstand the stresses of power fluctuations. Damage caused by this spell uses the electrical damage rules on p. 224. By directing the flow away from a subject, she subtracts the spell’s Potency from the damage of an electrical source. Each level of Potency in the spell allows the mage to control one line of power. If she diverts it somewhere else, the Storyteller determines what occurs — a socket or device could overload, or if the mage is careful she can avoid damaging components and simply change the course of power. If instead she wants to diminish the power, it drops by one level for each point of Potency; a Potency of reduces a subway line’s current to that of an ordinary wall socket, for example, or Potency cuts it completely.

When a mage could use her Defense against an object, she may use this spell instead to redirect it as an instant action. If cast with a prolonged Duration, the mage may take a Dodge action each turn and use this spell instead of receiving the normal benefits for Dodging. The spell allows the mage to turn a number of moving objects up to Potency. She does not have fine control over where each object is deflected, and the spell cannot make objects reverse direction entirely, only veer off target. The maximum Size of a redirected object is determined by the spell’s Scale factor. Because the spell acts upon an object’s momentum and not the object itself, the weight and speed are irrelevant to this spell’s effect; if the mage can use the spell, the magic will thwart any object within its parameters. The redirected object maintains all its original momentum. By default, the Storyteller determines a random direction for the object to travel when redirected.",

She can grant herself claws or gills, change a harmless herbivore into a venom-spitting killer, or impart limbs and air-breathing lungs to a shark, among other changes.

The magic is capable of affecting even microscopic organisms, if the mage can perceive them, but for life obvious reasons most microbes cannot benefit from aspects like armor, limbs, or senses. The mage can grant viruses and bacteria increased Toxicity, or the ability to replicate or survive in environments that might otherwise kill them. Because of the sheer variety of adaptations displayed by the world’s flora and fauna, the following is not an exhaustive list, but serves as an example for possible traits: Claws: The subject gains savage claws, granting her a +weapon bonus. Environmental Adaptation: Like creatures adapted for life deep underwater or inhospitable deserts, the subject gains the ability to survive pressure, extreme heat or cold (up to level environments), and arid or moisture-heavy environments. Gills/Lungs: The subject may breathe underwater (or in air, if normally aquatic) freely. Immunities: The mage may grant resistance to toxins or poisonous materials, like a rat’s ability to devour even rotten food unharmed or herbivores’ ability to fully digest plant matter. Leaping: Gaining powerful legs like a frog’s or kangaroo’s, the target gains a bonus to jumping rolls, increasing the distance leaped by each success on the Athletics roll. Prehensile Tail: Gain a bonus to rolls related to balance or climbing equal to Potency. Scaly Armor/Thick Hide: The subject gains 2/armor (must be at least Size 2). Senses: The subject gains a new sense, such as echolocation, primitive infravision, or a keen sense for vibrations, granting a bonus to Perception rolls and the ability to perceive phenomena outside the human senses. Tentacles: The subject may make grappling attempts against targets up to her Size in feet away. Venom: The subject gains fangs or small stingers (damage bonus 0) capable of injecting venom with a Toxicity equal to the spell’s Potency. Must grapple first unless a second level of this adaptation is taken. If taken with Tentacles, the Venom may be delivered automatically by any successful move during a grapple. Wall-Crawling: The subject (which can be no larger than Size 7) gains the ability to climb on surfaces without equipment or even handholds, provided the surface can bear her weight. +Reach: The bestowed traits, if made indefinite, can be passed on to the creature’s descendants.",

This isn’t full mind control and she doesn’t have Swarms Some mages shapechange into swarms of small creatures, Size 1 (rats) or Size 0 (insects). The Scale factor of the spell covers the total size of the swarm, chosen when the spell is cast. The swarm moves at the mage’s normal Speed, modified by the creatures’ Size, and also makes use of any special movement abilities the creatures may possess, like flight or wall-crawling. All individuals caught in the swarm, whether allies or enemies, suffer from panic and limited visibility and hearing. Victims suffer the persistent Distracted Condition until they escape the swarm. Swarms are difficult to harm. After rolling attacks against the swarm as normal, factoring in armor and other modifiers, the swarm takes one point of damage of the appropriate type, two points with an exceptional success on the attack. Fire, explosions, chemical sprays, and other area effects cause normal damage. Swarms aren’t capable of conventional combat against human-sized opponents, but may, depending on their composition, apply an extreme environment hazard to creatures they envelop. chapter four: magic access to the creature’s thoughts.

Her body continues to breathe, tire, and age as normal, but she loses her Defense and remains only semi-aware of what transpires around her body.

He may move freely, examine objects, take any Mental actions, heal, touch things, and even cast spells with himself as the subject, but not physically move, consume, or injure anything — any attempt to do so immediately ends the spell, but returns the subject to the timeline having just completed the action he attempted. chapter four: magic Attainments Attainments are magical effects, similar to spells but not subject to the same rules. They allow a mage to employ meta-magical effects in order to improve the efficacy of her Arcana and change the world around her in lasting ways. Attainments are available to all mages as their understanding of magic (as measured by the Arcana) increases. As a mage’s rating in an Arcanum increases, she gains access to new Attainments. The Orders instruct their members on how to use these abilities, but the instruction bears more resemblance to conditioning in athletics or fundamental principles in mathematics. In game terms, Attainments use a variety of mechanics. Some are instant actions, some extended, and some don’t require dice at all. Many of them require the expenditure of Mana, or allow the mage to use Mana to boost their power and effectiveness. Attainments do not require Imagos and as such cannot be countered by Counterspell, Universal Counterspell, or any other Attainments that affect spells. Adding an Attainment to a spell, however, does not prevent it from being Countered. One-Dot Attainments Counterspell Knowledge of one Arcanum imparts the understanding of how to unravel it. To cast a spell, the mage forms an Imago; to counter a spell, the mage simply needs to disrupt one. The Counterspell Attainment is actually different Attainments, one for each Arcanum. By learning even the most basic principles of an Arcanum, a mage understands how to counter a spell. By the time a spell takes effect and a mage feels it in Peripheral Mage Sight, though, it’s too late to counter; to use this Attainment, the countering mage must see her rival casting in Active Mage Sight. System: Counterspell is a Clash of Wills (see p. 117), pitting the acting mage’s Gnosis + Arcanum against the countering mage’s Gnosis + Arcanum. A mage can attempt to counter any spell that uses the Arcanum, even if it uses other Arcana as well, but always counters the highest Arcanum of a target spell. The comparative ratings of the two mages’ Arcana are irrelevant; an Initiate can, in theory, counter the spell of a Master. Countering the spell of a mage with a higher rating in the target Arcanum, however, requires that the player spend a point of Mana. Counterspell requires an instant action. If the mage is employing Active Mage Sight (see p. 90), she can attempt to counter a spell of the appropriate Arcanum in combat, regardless of her position in the Initiative order, provided she has not used her action yet. Example: A Moros mage is using Active Death Sight during a fight with some Seers of the Throne. She sees that one of them is about to cast a Death spell at one of her compatriots. Even if the Seer acts before her in the Initiative order, she can attempt to Counterspell. If the Seer had been readying a Forces spell, the Moros would have noticed it, but could not attempt to counter it with Death (she could, however, use Universal Counterspell if she had Prime 2 — see below). Two-Dot Attainments The second dot of an Arcanum grants a Lesser Utility Attainment and a form of Mage Armor. Lesser Utilities are Attainments that fit into the purview of the Arcana, but don’t map to the Practices and rely more on a general understanding of the Arcanum in question than of specific spells. Below are some of the most common Lesser Utilities, though the players and the Storyteller may devise others. Death: Eyes of the Dead The mage can see ghosts and souls in Twilight when using Active Mage Sight with Death. Her Peripheral Mage Sight reacts to even the passive presence of ghosts. System: The mage detects ghosts and deathly Twilight phenomena with her Periphery, and can automatically see souls and ghosts in Twilight with her Death Sight. If a ghost is using a power to hide, it provokes a Clash of Wills. With the expenditure of one point of Mana, the mage can interact with ghosts for a scene. She can speak with them, touch them, and even strike them. However, this renders her vulnerable to their attentions, as well. Fate: Conditional Duration The mage can, as well as assigning Duration with a spell factor, create a condition under which the spell ceases to function. Doing so can increase the Duration of a spell, although the mage must still spend Mana and a Reach if Duration becomes indefinite. The more improbable the condition, the smaller the bonus to Duration. Some mages use the Conditional Duration to levy curses designed to teach a target a lesson (“You will suffer boils on your hands until you dirty your hands helping another out of kindness.”), while others employ this Attainment tactically (“This floor will vanish the second I snap this glass rod.”). System: Spend a point of Mana to add a Conditional Duration to a spell. Doing so adds factors to the spell’s Duration based on the nature of the condition. An improbable condition (one that is unlikely to happen given current conditions) adds a level of Duration An infrequent condition (one that will eventually happen, but does not happen often on its own) adds two levels of Duration A common condition (one that will almost certainly happen in the near future) adds three levels of Duration. When the condition is met, the spell ends regardless of how much Duration remains. Forces: Precise Force The mage understands the intricacies of Forces to such a degree that she can optimize their intentional application, perfectly directing her energy when striking an object with a mundane attack or spell that involves a physical projectile. System: If the mage has a full turn to calculate her action, she can take the 9-Again quality on the roll. If she’s applying force to a stationary object, she can ignore two points of Durability, and attainments a successful hit automatically causes two additional Structure damage. Against a stationary, armored target, this strike destroys (and ignores) 1/armor if successful. This Attainment doesn’t work against anything moving faster than a casual walk. Life: Improved Pattern Restoration All mages can spend Mana to heal wounds, but an Apprentice of Life can use that Mana more efficiently, healing more or more serious wounds with the same amount of energy. In addition, Scouring her Pattern for Mana becomes easier and less detrimental. System: Instead of each bashing or lethal wound costing three points of Mana, the mage can heal bashing damage at a rate of one wound per point of Mana, and lethal damage at a rate of one wound per two points of Mana. In addition, if the mage Scours a Physical Attribute, any derived traits based on that Attribute are not affected (for instance, the mage can Scour a dot of Strength without losing a point of Speed). Matter: Permanence Changing an object’s nature and properties is easier than changing the nature of a living being. An Apprentice of Matter need simply make a small investment of energy to an object to make any Matter spell’s effects long-lasting. System: The character may spend one Mana instead of using a Reach to use the Advanced Duration spell factor of a spell with Matter as its highest Arcanum. Mind: Mind’s Eye The mage can see Goetia, other Astral entities, and beings using supernatural powers to project out of their bodies in Twilight when using Active Mage Sight with Mind. Her Peripheral Mage Sight reacts to even the passive presence of such entities. System: The mage detects Goetia and Mental Twilight phenomena with her Periphery, and can automatically see Goetia and projecting beings in Twilight with her Mind Sight. If a Goetia is using a power to hide, it provokes a Clash of Wills. With the expenditure of one point of Mana, the mage can interact with Goetia for a scene. She can speak with them, touch them, and even strike them. However, this renders her vulnerable to their attentions, as well. Prime: Universal Counterspell An Apprentice of Prime understands the formation of spells and the creation of an Imago well enough to attack it on a direct, metaphysical level, allowing her a great deal more defensive capability. System: The mage may use Counterspell on any Awakened spell. The player rolls Gnosis + Prime when the character does not know the Arcanum used, or when this would be a higher dice pool than the appropriate Arcanum. The mage may also spend a point of Mana to Counter a spell’s lowest Arcanum rather than its primary Arcanum. For example, a mage with this Attainment Countering a Fate 4, Space spell may pay a point of Mana to roll the Clash of Wills against Gnosis + Space instead of Gnosis + Fate. Space: Sympathetic Range An Apprentice of Space can cast spells using her sympathy to a subject she cannot see. The mage requires a sympathetic connection to the subject, and a Yantra symbolizing that subject to use as a focus for the spell. To use this Attainment, the mage must be casting a spell at sensory range, use a sympathy Yantra, and spend one Mana. The spell is Withstood by the fragility of the sympathetic connection (p.173), between the mage and her subject, but if the mage does not know the sympathetic name of the subject the Withstand level increases by one. Spirit: Spirit Eyes The mage can see spirits in Twilight when using Active Mage Sight with Spirit. Her Peripheral Mage Sight reacts to even the passive presence of such entities. System: The mage detects spiritual Twilight phenomena with her Periphery, and can automatically see spirits and projecting beings in Twilight with her Spirit Sight. If a spirit is using a power to hide, it provokes a Clash of Wills. With the expenditure of one point of Mana, the mage can interact with spirits for a scene. She can speak with them, touch them, and even strike them. However, this renders her vulnerable to their attentions, as well. Time: Temporal Sympathy Temporal Sympathy allows a mage to cast a Time spell at the past of a subject. The mage must be casting a spell on the subject as it exists now, cast at sensory range, use a sympathy Yantra, and spend one Mana. The spell is Withstood by the fragility of the temporal sympathy (p. 186) between the mage and her subject, plus one Withstand level if the mage does not know the sympathetic name of the subject. It is possible to combine this Attainment with Sympathetic Range to cast on a subject both in the past and at a distance beyond the sensory by paying to activate both Attainments, but unlike Sympathetic Range, Temporal Sympathy can only be used on Time spells that call for it and other spells Combined with them. Mage Armor Mage Armor is a set of Attainments, one per Arcanum, that allows a mage to protect herself magically. Mage Armor requires a point of Mana to activate with a reflexive action, whereupon it remains active for the scene, even if the mage falls unconscious, unless the mage dies. A mage can only benefit from one form of Mage Armor at a time, but can spend Mana to change between Arcana as a reflexive action. Mage Armors that increase Defense work against surprise attacks.",
